Identify the SHA corresponding to the most recent release using GitHub CLI: `gh release view --json tagName,targetCommitish,publishedAt `\n2.

Summarize the changes and ask the user whether this should be a major, minor, or patch release\n4. Create a changeset in .changeset/v[version].md instead of directly modifying package.json. The format is:\n\n---\n\"roo-cline\": patch|minor|major\n---\n\n# Changelog: v[current] ‚Üí v[new]\n\n## üîß Fixes\n[fixes with categorization]\n\n## üöÄ Features\n[features with categorization]\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Changes\n[internal changes]\n\n- Always include contributor attribution using format: (thanks @username!)\n- Provide brief descriptions under each item to explain the change\n\n5. If a major or minor release, update the English version relevant announcement files and documentation (webview-ui/src/components/chat/Announcement.tsx, README.md, and the `latestAnnouncementId` in src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts)\n6. Ask the user to confirm the English version\n7.
